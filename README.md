# Philippines Religion Data Archive:How it affects our social inequality
## Introduction
Philippines's Religion Data Archive, this topic provides us a lot of motivation Because the Philippines currently has numerous religions, it is beneficial for all of them. There are three major religions in the Philippines: Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim. However, many people in the Philippines construct their own churches and have their own views, therefore each religion has its own set of beliefs. So that, we'd like to make this possible. We can look up information on all religions in every city and conduct surveys to gather other people's perspectives. Aside from that, another goal of this project is to promote equality in all religions. The major goal of this project is to provide an instant response to some of the most commonly asked about religious issues. It's like asking how many Filipinos believe in God, or how often they pray or go to church, or which religion has the most devotees. This features help users obtain the information without having to search rough files. You simply choose whatever category you want to travel to in order to discover the answers to your questions. There include survey results, membership information, and so on.
