# Philippines Religion Data Archive:How it affects our social inequality
## Introduction
Religion is a distinguishing element of the way many people live and make decisions. It is an organized group of people's beliefs that typically pertains to one's faith and trust in a higher power. A person's religious beliefs may influence a variety of life decisions, but when aspects of that person's life conflict with religious values, it can be difficult to reconcile the two, leading to doubt and distress. This framework for Religion is ideal for a variety of purposes. It provides life meaning and purpose, strengthens social unity and stability, acts as a social control agent, promotes psychological and physical well-being, and may inspire people to work for constructive social change. Religion is said to promote subjective well-being in several ways: the religious community provides a sense of belonging and social support; religion gives people's lives meaning and purpose; and finally, religion helps people to live better lifestyles. Religion aids in the formation of an ethical framework as well as the regulation of values in daily life. This method aids in the development of a person's character. In other words, religion serves as a socializing agent. Religion thus contributes to the development of qualities such as love, empathy, respect, and harmony. This topic, Philippines' Religion Data Archive, gives us a lot of encouragement to learn about various religions because the Philippines has a lot of them, and it's good for all of them. In the Philippines, there are three major religions: Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim. Many people in the Philippines, on the other hand, build their own churches and hold their own beliefs, so each religion has its own set of beliefs. As a result, we'd like to make this happen. We may seek up information on all religions in any place and conduct surveys to learn more about other people's viewpoints. Aside from that, a secondary purpose of this project is to promote religious equality. This project's main purpose is to provide an immediate response to some of the most frequently asked questions about religious concerns. It's the equivalent of asking how many Filipinos believe in God, how often they pray or attend church, or which religion has the largest following. This kind of data sets allows us to acquire information without having to sift through a large number of files
